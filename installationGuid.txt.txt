# MediSync Pro: Local Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the MediSync Pro project on your local machine.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node Package Manager, which comes with Node.js.

## 2. Firebase Project Setup

This application is powered by Firebase. You will need to create your own Firebase project to run it locally.

### Step 2.1: Create a Firebase Project
1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **"Add project"** and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

### Step 2.2: Create a Web App
1.  Inside your new Firebase project, click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
2.  Give your app a nickname (e.g., "MediSync Pro Local").
3.  Click **"Register app"**. Firebase will provide you with a configuration object. **You will need this for the next step.**

### Step 2.3: Configure Firebase in the App
1.  In the project code, open the file: `src/firebase/config.ts`.
2.  Replace the existing `firebaseConfig` object with the one you copied from the Firebase console in the previous step.

### Step 2.4: Enable Firebase Services
1.  In the Firebase Console, go to the **"Build"** section in the left-hand menu.
2.  **Firestore Database**:
    - Click **"Firestore Database"**.
    - Click **"Create database"**.
    - Choose **"Start in test mode"** for local development (this allows open access, which is fine for a local setup but should be secured for production).
    - Select a location and click **"Enable"**.
3.  **Authentication**:
    - Click **"Authentication"**.
    - Click **"Get started"**.
    - Go to the **"Sign-in method"** tab.
    - Click on **"Email/Password"** from the list of providers, enable it, and click **"Save"**.

### Step 2.5: Set Up Security Rules
1.  In the Firebase Console, go to **"Firestore Database"** and click on the **"Rules"** tab.
2.  Copy the entire content from the `firestore.rules` file in the project's root directory.
3.  Paste the content into the rules editor in the Firebase Console, replacing any existing rules.
4.  Click **"Publish"**.

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The AI features of this app use Google's Gemini models via Genkit. You need an API key for this.

1.  Create an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  In the root of your project, find the `.env` file.
3.  Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you just created:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

## 4. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the project, and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## 5. Run the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server.

1.  To run the main Next.js application, use:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the app, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  To run the Genkit AI flows (required for the Symptom Checker), open a **second, separate terminal** and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

You need both servers running simultaneously for all features of the application to work correctly.

You should now be able to access the application in your browser and start using it!
